'Seven' - The Game, Requirements analysis
Description
'Seven' is a number based game which usually includes multiple players in a ring. The goal of the game is to count integers ascending starting with 1 until the game ends. Counting is done by one number at a time and once a player has said out loud the next number, turn progresses to the next person and so on. The catch of the game is that certain numbers are 'prohibited' and if they are said aloud (instead of saying skip), the game will end and the player who messed up loses. Now we come to the variation of the game 'Seven', which is my project. Basically the game is arcade-style and keeps track of user inputs and assures that the user types out the right numbers, and will give points according to how far the player will get.
